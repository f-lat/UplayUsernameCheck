# UplayUsernameCheck
checks to see if there's any 3 letter'd username available in Uplay. The username are not case sensitive as the case is neglected by the API I am using.


enter your email and password the auth command as strings.


# Very Important Note:
As the code prints the username that are available you have to remember to change the case if incase you try to use that username and the uplay says its taken, thats becasuse the username taken by the API are not case sensitive. You have to check a desired username by changing the case of each letter one by one.


if you have a better library/module that can check case aswell feel free to contribute.
